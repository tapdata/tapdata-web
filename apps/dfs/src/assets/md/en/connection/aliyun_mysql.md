## **Connection configuration help**

### **1. Aliyun RDS for MySQL Installation Instructions**

Follow the instructions below to ensure a successful MySQL database addition and use with Tapdata.

### **2. Supported Versions**
MySQL 5.0, 5.1, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 8.x

### **3. Prerequisites (as source)**
#### **3.1 Enable Binlog**
- MySQL's binlog must be enabled for Tapdata to complete the synchronization normally.
- Cascade delete (CASCADE DELETE), this type of delete generated by the database will not be recorded in the binlog, so it is not supported.
  Modify `$MYSQL_HOME/mysql.cnf `, for example:
````
server_id = 223344
log_bin = mysql-bin
expire_logs_days = 1
binlog_format = row
binlog_row_image = full
````
Configuration explanation: <br>
server-id: must be unique for each server and replication client in MySQL<br>
binlog_format: must be set to row or ROW<br>
binlog_row_image: must be set to full<br>
expire_logs_days: The number of days to keep the binary log file, it will be automatically deleted when it expires<br>
log_bin: The base name of the binlog sequence file<br>

#### **3.2 Restart MySQL**

````
/etc/inint.d/mysqld restart
````
To verify that binlog is enabled, execute the following command in the mysql shell
````
show variables like 'binlog_format';
````
In the output result, the format value should be "ROW"

Verify that the value of the binlog_row_image parameter is full:
````
show variables like 'binlog_row_image';
````
In the output, the binlog_row_image value should be "FULL"

#### **3.3 Create MySQL account**
After Mysql8, the password encryption method is different. Please pay attention to using the corresponding version method and set the password, otherwise it will cause the failure to perform incremental synchronization.
Use the following command to confirm whether supplemental logging is enabled
##### **3.3.1 5.x version**
````
create user 'username'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
````
##### **3.3.2 8.x version**
````
// create user
create user 'username'@'localhost' identified with mysql_native_password by 'password';
// change Password
alter user 'username'@'localhost' identified with mysql_native_password by 'password';

````

#### **3.4 Authorize tapdata account**
Grant select permission to a database
````
GRANT SELECT, SHOW VIEW, CREATE ROUTINE, LOCK TABLES ON <DATABASE_NAME>.<TABLE_NAME> TO 'tapdata' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
````
global permissions
````
GRANT RELOAD, SHOW DATABASES, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'tapdata' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
````
#### **3.5 Constraint Description**
````
When synchronizing from MySQL to other heterogeneous databases, if the source MySQL has table cascade settings, the data updates and deletions triggered by the cascade will not be transmitted to the target. If a cascade processing capability needs to be built on the target side, this type of data synchronization can be realized by means of triggers, etc., depending on the target situation.
````
### **4. Prerequisites (as goals)**
Grant full permissions to a database
````
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <DATABASE_NAME>.<TABLE_NAME> TO 'tapdata' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
````
global permissions
````
GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO 'tapdata' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
````
### **5. Common mistakes**

Unknown error 1044
If the permission has been granted, but the test connection cannot be passed through tapdata, you can check and fix it through the following steps
````
SELECT host,user,Grant_priv,Super_priv FROM mysql.user where user='username';
//Check if the value of the Grant_priv field is Y
//If not, execute the following command
UPDATE mysql.user SET Grant_priv='Y' WHERE user='username';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
````
